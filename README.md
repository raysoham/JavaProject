# Course Manager

## Java Project by Soham

- I want to create an application which can keep track of a student's 
details, and the courses they are registered in with their details.
Courses can be added to or deleted from a Student, a singular Course's
details can be viewed, a Student's details can be viewed, etc. 
User stories will explain more detailed functionality. I may add further 
 functionality as the Project phases progress.

- This will be useful for Students trying to keep track of 
their courses and all the details.

- This is interesting to me as a first year student because I
had a hard time keeping track of all my courses, especially with
different timezones. It would have really helped me if this project
already existed as an application, but it didn't. So I thought I
will make it and in the future no one will have to struggle with
keeping a track of all their courses.

## To start
